# Decision Stumps & Adaboost

Part I : We implement a Decision Stumps classifier

Part II : We implement the AdaBoost method defined on pages 658-659 in Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" (Section 14.3) and use Decision Stumps as weak classifiers.

We also test the AdaBoost classifier on the Iris dateset and achive **95% test accuracy**.
