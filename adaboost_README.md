# Decision Stumps & Adaboost

Part I : Decision Stumps

Part II : We implement the AdaBoost method defined on pages 658-659 in Bishop (Section 14.3) and use Decision Stumps as weak classifiers.

We also test both the Decision Stumps and the AdaBoost classifiers on the Iris dateset and achive 95% test accuracy for both.
